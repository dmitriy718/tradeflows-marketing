## Quick orientation for AI coding agents

This repository is a static marketing site built with React + Vite. The goal of this file is to surface the minimum, high-value knowledge an automated coding agent needs to be productive here.

Keep changes small and targeted. Preserve public assets and external links (the product app is at `https://app.tradeflows.net`).

### Big picture
- Frontend-only SPA (React 18) using Vite. No server-side code in this repo.
- Routing and page boundaries are defined in `src/App.jsx` (React Router v6). Key dynamic routes:
  - `/blog/:slug` handled by `src/pages/BlogPost.jsx`
  - `/knowledge-base/:slug` handled by `src/pages/KBArticle.jsx`
- Content is data-driven and lives in `src/data` (example: `src/data/blogPosts.js`). Add/update posts here — pages read from those helpers (`getPostBySlug`, `getAllPosts`, etc.).

### Key files and directories (refer to them when making changes)
- `package.json` — dev / build / preview / lint scripts. Use these exact commands for local workflows.
- `vite.config.js` — build output goes to `dist`, server defaults (port 3000), and vendor chunking is configured (`manualChunks.react-vendor`).
- `public/` — static assets (SVGs, images). Reference from code with absolute paths like `/logo-full.svg`.
- `src/components/` — shared UI (Navigation, Footer, ScrollToTop).
- `src/pages/` — page-level components and per-page CSS files (e.g., `HomePage.jsx`, `HomePage.css`). Follow that pattern.
- `src/data/` — canonical content and small data helpers (e.g., `blogPosts.js`). Treat this as the CMS for this repo.

### Developer workflows (concrete commands)
- Start dev server: `npm run dev` (Vite, opens on port 3000).
- Build for production: `npm run build` -> outputs `dist/` (minified, uses terser).
- Preview built site locally: `npm run preview` (serves `dist/`).
- Linting: `npm run lint` (ESLint configured in package.json). There are no unit tests in the repo.

When running a build, remember the site is an SPA: server hosting must serve index.html for unknown routes (fallback to index.html) so client-side routing works.

### Project-specific patterns and conventions
- JSX + CSS co-location: most pages have an accompanying CSS file in `src/pages` or `src/components`. Follow that naming when adding UI.
- Data-first pages: blog and KB pages read from `src/data/*`. To add content, append a new object to the appropriate array and set `slug`, `id`, `publishDate`, `featured`, etc., then the pages will pick it up automatically.
- Meta and SEO: pages set <title> and meta via `react-helmet-async` (see `HomePage.jsx` and `BlogPage.jsx`). Keep that pattern when adding pages.
- External product links: navigation and CTAs link to `https://app.tradeflows.net`. Avoid changing these unless explicitly requested.

### Common tasks — concrete examples
- Add a new page:
  1. Create `src/pages/YourPage.jsx` and `src/pages/YourPage.css` following existing pages.
  2. Export a default component.
  3. Add a route in `src/App.jsx` (e.g., `<Route path="/your-path" element={<YourPage/>} />`).

- Add a blog post:
  1. Edit `src/data/blogPosts.js` and add an object to `blogPosts` with keys matching existing entries (`id`, `slug`, `title`, `content`, `publishDate`, `featured`, `author`, etc.).
  2. Use `getAllPosts()` / `getPostBySlug()` helpers already implemented.

### Integration points and gotchas
- SPA routing: because BrowserRouter is used (`src/main.jsx`), deep links require server fallback to `index.html` in production.
- Images & static assets: place new assets in `public/` and reference them with an absolute path (e.g., `/blog/image.jpg`). Do not import image files with bundler routes unless intentionally bundling them.
- Build artifacts: `dist/` is generated by `npm run build`. There are release artifacts in the repo (`dist.tar.gz`) and deploy scripts (`deploy.ps1`, `deploy.sh`) — inspect those before changing deployment behavior.
- Vite manualChunks: `vite.config.js` already splits vendor libs (`react`, `react-dom`, `react-router-dom`) to `react-vendor` — keep this optimization unless there's a specific reason to change it.

### Editing safety rules for automated agents
- Preserve public assets and external product URLs unless the change is explicitly about them.
- Avoid touching `package.json` dependency versions without a clear rationale and tests; this repo targets Vite 5 and React 18.
- Follow existing naming and file co-location patterns (component .jsx + .css in same folder) to keep the repository consistent.

### Where to look next (important reference files)
- `src/App.jsx` — route map and page boundaries.
- `src/data/blogPosts.js` — canonical blog data and helpers.
- `src/components/Navigation.jsx` — navigation structure and external links.
- `vite.config.js` and `package.json` — build/dev/preview/lint commands and build config.
